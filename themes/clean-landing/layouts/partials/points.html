      <p>OSM runs an <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">Envoy</a> based control plane on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, can be configured with <a href="https://smi-spec.io">SMI</a> APIs and works by injecting an Envoy proxy as a sidecar container next to each instance of your application.</p>
      <p>The proxy contains and executes rules around access control policies, implements routing configuration, and captures metrics. The control plane continually configures proxies to ensure policies and routing rules are up to date and ensures proxies are healthy.</p>
