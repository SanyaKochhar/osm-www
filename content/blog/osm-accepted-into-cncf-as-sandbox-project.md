We are delighted to announce that the Open Service Mesh (OSM) project has been accepted to enter the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a [sandbox](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/) project.  

Having Open Service Mesh be openly governed is a priority for the project maintainers, as was stated in the initial [launch blog](https://openservicemesh.io/blog/introducing-open-service-mesh/). The open governance structure provided by the CNCF allows developers across the ecosystem to easily contribute to the project under the auspices of the CNCF. 

Now that OSM has met this milestone, we look forward to growing the community and continuing to provide a simple, stable, Envoy-based control plane that natively implements the complete set of [Service Mesh Interface (SMI) APIs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec#service-mesh-interface-documents). Additionally, we hope organizations that have written their own in-house service mesh implementations consider collaborating on the project so that OSM can leverage the collective experience. 

As for what comes next for OSM, the community is hard at work fully implementing the SMI APIs along with focusing on stability and end-to-end testing. You can follow the project [roadmap](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) for further detail. 

If youâ€™re interested in learning more about OSM, check out the initial [launch blog](https://www.cncf.io/sandbox-projects/). You can also check out the communication [channels](https://openservicemesh.io/) or the [Github repo](https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm) to familiarize yourself with the project. 

We will be holding our first community meeting starting October 13th, 2020 at 1:30pm-2pm EDT / 10:30am-11am PDT. More information to come for the meeting details for joining soon. We look forward to working with you building OSM in the community.
